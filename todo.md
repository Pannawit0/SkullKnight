# TODO

- [x] Tutorial

- [x] let the player restart the game (without reloading the page)
- [x] show player the roll input tutorial text before the super laser so they have time to read it
- [x] player retry needs to reset progression

  - waves of enemies (rounds) 
  - powerups (different attacks, armor)
  - change of setting (change areas)
